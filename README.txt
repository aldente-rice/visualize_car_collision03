Purpose:
Visualize the motor collision dataset. Set up visualization in a way that allows for analyzation of
possible correlations between things like the vehicle type (sedan, suv), by brand, by time of day, etc.


Libraries
Pandas (deal with the large dataset)
Matplotlib (visualize the data)

"As the other commenter said, 1M rows is actually not even really that big. It’s too big for excel,
for sure, but not so big that you can’t handle it in Python or R. You’ll eventually find yourself
needing to practice more with data exploration in a programming language. So practice plotting the
data, plotting subsets of data, checking each variable so you know what it is, what its distribution
looks like, where the extreme value are, what the median and mode are, where there is missingness, etc.

It just takes practice, but if you dedicate yourself to it, you’ll soon be good at exploratory data
analysis and will be able to be familiar with a dataset without even opening excel."
